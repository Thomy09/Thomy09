        <h3 id="causes">Causes of the conflict</h3>
        <p>There are two major causes of this conflict: territorial and ideological.</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="territorialCause">
            <p><strong>Territorial cause:</strong><br>Korea had been one country before the 20th century, which is for both countries the reason to conquer the other part of Korea: to make one country again. The leaders of North and South-Korea believed that their
              state should rule the whole Korean region.</p>
          </li>
          <li id="ideologicalCause">
            <p><strong>Ideological cause:</strong><br>The other reason for this conflict is the big difference in ideology: the communist state in the North opposing the democratic and anti-communist state in the South. The North wanted to extend communism, while the
              South wanted to defeat communism. This ideological difference is also the reason why America, the Soviet Union and China were participating so fiercely in this conflict. America wanted to defeat communism and therefore supported
              South-Korea and the Soviet Union and China wanted to extend communism and therefore support North-Korea in this conflict.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="korean_war">Start of the conflict and the Korean War</h3>
        <p>On 22 August 1910, The Japanese Empire took control of Korea to include it into its expanding empire. However, at the end of WW2 the US and the USSR Both took a part of Korea and the idea was to unite Korea to become one nation again. The
          Soviet Union had taken the north and turned it into a communist state and the US had taken care of the south. Tension started to rise due to the Cold War. On June 25 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. In doing so they tried to create
          one big Korean Nation that was completely under a communist regime. South Korea responded with the help of the US and was able to drive the North Koreans back after they almost completely had taken over Korea. South Korea was able to drive
          the North Korean back into Chinese territory. China helped the North Koreans to come back. However, on July 27 1953, a truce was signed which ended the fighting, but officially the war was still going on.</p>

        <h3 id="consequences">Consequences of the conflict</h3>
        <p>Right after the war, families were broken up and lived on opposite sides, they were unable to visit or even communicate with each other. To this day, there are still many families that are divided due to this conflict but they are allowed
          to meet each other from time to time. Next to that, the impact on the Korean population was dramatic. With more than three million casualties. In addition, there were huge economic consequences. This is mainly due to the fact that most
          industrial facilities were destroyed. North Korea even fell into a lot of poverty. Despite this South Korea has made a lot of economical progress, even to this day North Korea is not able to keep up with the economical pace of South Korea.
          Except for Korea the US, China and the USSR also noticed consequences of the war. So have the Americans drastically increased their army by increasing their defence budget to $60 billion in 1952. As for China and the USSR, tension rose as
          they discussed who had to pay for the damage. China came to the conclusion that the USSR was an unreliable and demanding ally. In 1960, China, therefore, decided to ensure independence from the USSR.

        <h3 id="conflictEnd">End of the Conflict?</h3>
        <p>It seems that there is an end of this conflict because the two countries are both prepared to forget about it. In 2018, the leader of South-Korea, Moon Jae-in, and the leader of North-Korea, Kim Jong-un, signed the Panmunjom Declaration.
          With this, they declared that there will be no more war between North and South-Korea and thus that there will be peace between those two countries. In the same year, they organized the Olympic Games together in PyeongChang.</p>
